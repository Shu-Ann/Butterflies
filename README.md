# Butterflies

The dataset is based on `Butterfly biodiversity survey 2017`(https://data.melbourne.vic.gov.au/Environment/Butterfly-biodiversity-survey-2017/kmtd-nvqr).

This project will only include a modified subset of the original data which contains the records of the
observations in 15 sites during January to March in 2017 at City of Melbourne's public green spaces.


## Introduction 
The project is to use `R Shiny`, `ggplot2`, and `Leaflet` to create a data visualisation using the modified dataset.
